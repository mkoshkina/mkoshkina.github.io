I am a PhD candidate at [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://eecs.lassonde.yorku.ca/'), York University, working under the supervision of [Dr. James Elder](https://www.elderlab.yorku.ca/). My PhD research focuses on video understanding for sports. I am a professional software developer with over 15 years of experience. I received my MSc and BSc in Computer Science from York University in 2003 and 2001.
