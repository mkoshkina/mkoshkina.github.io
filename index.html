			<h2> About </h2>
			<div class='section'>
			I am a professional software developer with over 15 years of experience. I am currently pursuing a PhD in computer science at Department of <a href='http://eecs.lassonde.yorku.ca/'>Electrical Engineering and and Computer Science, York University</a> under supervision of <a href='https://www.elderlab.yorku.ca/'>Prof James Elder</a>.  My PhD research focuses on video understanding for sports.  I am also currently working as Maching Learning Team Lead at <a href='http://geminare.com'>Geminare Inc</a>.

			<h3> Player Tracking </h2>
			<div class='section'>
			Detecting and tracking players throughout the game is important for game analysis and automatic stats collection. It supports other sports video understanding tasks such as game event detection.  Current state-of-the-art approaches are mostly focused on MOT (Multi-object tracking) of pedestrians and vehicles. Tracking players bring its own challenges: players on the same team have very similar appearance, fast motion and frequent occlusions complicate the task.  In our research, we are building on top of current MOT state-of-the-art methods while addressing sports-specific challenges.

			<h3> Unsupervised Player Classification </h3>
			<div class='section'>
			We address the problem of unsupervised classification of players in a team sport according to their team affiliation, when jersey colours and design are not known a priori. We adopt a contrastive learning approach in which an embedding network learns to maximize the distance between representations of players on different teams relative to players on the same team, in a purely unsupervised fashion, without any labelled data. We evaluate the approach using a new hockey dataset and find that it outperforms prior unsupervised approaches by a substantial margin, particularly for real-time application when only a small number of frames are available for unsupervised learning before team assignments must be made. Remarkably, we show that our contrastive method achieves 94% accuracy after unsupervised training on only a single frame, with accuracy rising to 97% within 500 frames (17 seconds of game time). We further demonstrate how accurate team classification allows accurate team-conditional heat maps of player positioning to be computed.<br>
